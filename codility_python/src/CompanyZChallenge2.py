'''
Write a function solution that, given two integers A and B, returns the maximum number of
repeated square root operations that can be performed using the numbers from the interval [A..B]
(both ends included) as starting points. Square root operations can be performed as long
as the result is still an integer.
For example, given A = 10, B = 20, the function should return 2. Starting with the integer 16, two 
square root operations can be performed: sqrt(16) = 4 and then sqrt(4) = 2.
Given A = 6000 and B = 7000, the function should return 3. Starting with integer 6561, three square 
root operations can be performed: sqrt(6561) = 81, sqrt(81) = 9 and sqrt(9) = 3.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
    * A and B are integers within the range [2..1,000,000,000];
    * A â‰¤ B.
